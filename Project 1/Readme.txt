Main File : 
	Hashing.java (Project1/src) 

Executing the program : 

1) In terminal go to the location where the program file : Hashing.java
2) Enter the command javac Hashing.java to compile the code.
3) Enter the command java Hashing.java to run the code.
4) Enter the inputs for Number of flows, Number of table entries, Number of hashes, Type of hashing(multi-hashing or cuckoohashing or d-lefthashing), Number of cuckoo steps,
and Number of segments.
5) After all the inputs are given respective hashing output files(multi-hashing.txt, cuckooHashing.txt, and dLeftHashing.txt) will be created for type of hashing you entered 
as input.

There are four files in src folder. 

1) Hashing.java : It has the code that is implemented for Multi-Hashing, Cuckoo Hashing, and D-left Hashing.

2) multi-hashing.txt: This file contains the Total number of flows, Total number of entries in the Hash array, Flowid and its respective index in the hash array generated 
after implementing Multi-Hashing. If any entry has 0 value, it means that it doesn't have flow id.

3)cuckoohashing.txt: This file contains the Total number of flows, Total number of entries in the Hash array, Flowid and its respective index in the hash array generated 
after implementing Cuckoo Hashing. If any entry has 0 value, it means that it doesn't have flow id.

4)dLeftHashing.txt: This file contains the Total number of flows, Total number of entries in the Hash array, Flowid and its respective index in the hash array generated 
after implementing D-left Hashing. If any entry has 0 value, it means that it doesn't have flow id.

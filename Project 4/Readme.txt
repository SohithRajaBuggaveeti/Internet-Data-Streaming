Main File :
	BitMaps.java (Project4/src)

Executing the program : 

1) In terminal go to the location where the program file : BitMaps.java
2) Enter the command javac BitMaps.java to compile the code.
3) Enter the command java BitMaps to run the code.
4) Enter the inputs for Number of bits in Bitmap array, Number of registers, Number of bits in each register, Type of Mapping(bitmap or probabilistic_bitmap or hyperloglog).
5) After all the inputs are given respective filter output files(bitmap.txt, probabilistic_bitmap.txt, and hyperloglog.txt) will be created for type of filter you entered
as input.

There are four files in src folder. 

1) BitMap.java : It has the code that is implemented for Bit Map, Probabilistic BitMap, HyperLogLog.

2) bitmap.txt: This file contains the True spread and estimated spread after bitmap implementation.

3)probabilistic_bitmap.txt: This file contains the True spread and estimated spread after probabilistic bitmap implementation.

4)hyperloglog.txt: This file contains the True spread and estimated spread after probabilistic Hyperloglog implementation
